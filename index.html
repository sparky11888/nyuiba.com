						At NYU Stern, study abroad is highly encouraged and rewarding. With the NYU portal sites and Stern's IBEX program, there are ample opportunities for students to learn about the world and themselves.

					<h1>Get More Involved with Leadership Roles</h1>
					
					<h2>The Executive Board</h2>
					<p>
						Every spring club members have an opportunity to run for a position on the IBA executive board. This is a great opportunity to get more involved with the higher management of the club and explore leadership within Stern. When the time is near, more information about Executive Board will be distributed to club members.  
					</p>
					
					<h2>Project Management Committee</h2>
					<p>
						The Project Management Committee is a select group of 5 or so students that will overlook a series of projects for IBA over the Spring semester. They will be representatives as well as have specific roles within the committee. The PMC will also be responsible for creating IBA's 2015 ISP guide as well as organizing events. Being a part of our PMC is a great way to not only substantiate yourself within IBA but also to be at the heart of the association; PMC members are expected to join all weekly e-board meetings and have a higher chance of being elected into IBA's e-board.
